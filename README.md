## Description

 The Tech Blog provides developers with a forum to share their experiences and perspectives within the coding industry through blog posts that can be viewed and commented on by other members of the community. Using the Model View Controller framework, this application retrieves posts made by site members and stores them in a mySQL database. The posts are rendered to the browser using .handlebars templates and also includes an option to comment on each individual entry for those who sign up with a username, e-mail address, and password. Login information is tracked with the express-session middleware module to ensure that only account-holders are able to create and comment on posts.
